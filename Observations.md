#Intersting things i observed with micropond

# Observations #

Here a small list of intersting things i observed thanks to micropond:

## Hostile places ##
What i found very intersting is, no matter how many bugs i had in my application, life always somehow evolved, even if it was nearly impossible sometimes with some of the bugs. Life always finds a way :-)

## System abuse ##
When i make mistake a in the instruction set, and there is somehow a way to abuse the system to have a huge advantage over the other creatures, then this way will be found sooner or later.
Here a little example:
The eat command lets you eat a instruction from a neighbour genome. this instruction will be replaced with 0 (reset) and can no longer be eaten. This means, there is normaly only a limited amount of energy that can be "created" by eating each round.
But when combining the eating with the kill command, the cell can reset the genome of the neighbour cell, and like that, eat infinite energy. never thought of that.. but the creatures found it out.
