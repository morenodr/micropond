# Goal #
The goal of Micropond is to write an artificial life simulator, similar to nanopond, but with many additional features.

Micropond is written in C++, and is much easier to modify than nanopond, specialy if you want to replace the instruction set (there is no limitation to 16 instructions like nanopond has).

Micropond is multithreaded, and there is a exchange between the different threads.
